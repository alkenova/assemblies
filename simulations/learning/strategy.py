    Defining the strategy of simulation builder:
        1) Simple: all stimuli directly fire at a single area (which fires at the output area)
        2) Layered: every two 'sibling' stimuli fires at a unique area ('first layer'), which, together with
            its sibling area, fires at a unique area ('second layer'), until it finally converges into a single
            area ('last layer') - which fires at the output area. An illustration (for input size of 2):

                    Stimulus A   Stimulus B         Stimulus C   Stimulus D ...
