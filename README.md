## Installation

1. Clone the repository and enter it:

    ```sh
    $ git clone git@github.com:BrainProjectTau/Brain.git
    ...
    $ cd Brain/
    ```

2. Run the installation script and activate the virtual environment:

    ```sh
    $ ./scripts/install.sh
    ...
    $ source .env/bin/activate
    [Brain] $ # you're good to go!
    ```

3. To check that everything is working as expected, run the tests:

    ```sh
    $ pytest tests/
    ...
    ```

## Usage

The `Brain` packages provides the following classes:
    
- `Area`

    This class represents an Area in the brain.

    ```pycon
    >>> from Brain import Area
    >>> area = Area(beta = 0.1, n = 10 ** 7, k = 10 ** 4)
    ```

    The area class provides methods for handling areas within the brain.
    - `read`
        returns the most active assembly in an area. Can be called by an area object in the following manner:
        ```pycon
        >>> read_assembly = area.read(preserve_brain=True, brain=brain)
        ```
        
- `Assembly`
    
    This class represents an Assembly in the brain.
    
    ```pycon
    >>> from assembly_calculus import Area, Stimulus, Assembly, BrainRecipe
    >>> area = Area(beta = 0.1, n = 10 ** 7, k = 10 ** 4)
    >>> stim = Stimulus(1000 ** 0.5)
    >>> assembly = Assembly([stim], area)
    >>> recipe = BrainRecipe(stim, area, assembly)
    ```
    
    Representing multiple assemblies and operating on them can be achieved using `|` in the following manner:
    
    ```pycon
    >>> assembly_set = (ass1 | ass2 | ass3)         # this represents the set of these 'ass1', 'ass2', 'ass3'
    >>> assembly_singelton = (ass| ...)             # this represents the singleton containing 'ass'
    ```
    The assembly class provides methods for manipulating assemblies within the brain.
    
    - `project`
        takes an assembly in a certain area and creates a copy of that assembly
        in another area. Can be called using `>>` in the following manner:
    
        ```pycon
        >>> with recipe:
                assembly_ac = assembly_a >> area_c  # assuming assembly_a is in area_a, this creates a projection in area_c
                assembly_bc = assembly_b >> area_c
        ```
       
    - `merge`
        takes two assemblies from two areas and creates an assembly in a third area
        that fires together with both of them. Can be called using `|` and `>>` in the following manner:
        
        ```pycon
        >>> with recipe:
                (assembly_a | assembly_b) >> area_c
        ```
        
    - `associate`
        takes two assemblies in a certain area and associates them such that
        they fire together. Can be called on more than one assembly using `|` in the following manner:
        
        ```pycon
        >>> with recipe:
                (assembly_ac | ...).associate(assembly_bc | ...)
        ```
        
    
- `Connectome`
    
    Sub-package which holds the structre of the brain.
    The sub-package defines the following classes:
    
    - `Connectome`
        Abstract class which defines the API which a general connectome should have.
        This class should be inhereted and implemented.
        
        ```pycon
        >>> from Connectome import Connectome
        >>> class LazyConnectome(Connectome):
        >>>     #implementation of a specific connectome
        >>>> connectome = LazyConnectome()
        >>> area = Area(beta = 0.1, n = 10 ** 7, k = 10 ** 4)
        >>> connectome.add_area(area)
        ```
    - `NonLazyRandomConnectome` 
        Already implemented Connectome which by decides it's edge by chance.
        This Connectome doesn't use any kind of laziness.
       
       ```pycon
        >>> from Connectome import NonLazyRandomConnectome
        >>>> connectome = NonLazyRandomConnectome()
        >>> area = Area(beta = 0.1, n = 10 ** 7, k = 10 ** 4)
        >>> connectome.add_area(area)
        ```
    - `To be continued`
        More ways to implement a connectome can be applied simply by inhereting from Connectome and implementing it's API.
    
- `Brain`

    This class represents a simulated brain, with it's connectome which holds the areas, stimuli, and all the synapse weights.

    ```pycon
    >>> from Brain import Brain, NonLazyRandomConnectome, Area
    >>> connectome = NonLazyRandomConnectome()
    >>> area = Area(beta = 0.1, n = 10 ** 7, k = 10 ** 4)
    >>> connectome.add_area(area)
    >>> brain = Brain(connectome)
    ```
