        Create a new configuration and initialize tracking attributes, using the
        following logic:
            A sequence can run for a variable (user defined) number
            of cycles. Each cycle contains a number of iterations, as defined
            before the sequence is finalized. Each iteration is defined to run a
            certain number of consecutive runs.

        So we get:
         - current_cycle: the current cycle number (out of the total cycles) for
            the current usage of the sequence.
         - current_iter: the current number of iteration within the cycle.
         - current_run: the current number of run out of the defined consecutive
            runs for this iteration.

        Note that we also define flag - is_in_mid_run - stating whether this
        configuration started to track a run of the sequence, to prevent from
        accidentally using the sequence starting from the middle of a cycle or
        iteration. After this flag is set, there is no way to unset it (a new
        configuration must be created, ensuring the sequence will start running
        from the beginning).
